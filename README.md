# Akademia Albania Web
The project, in simple words is about providing video and scripted information, in the form of tutorials mostly in Albanian to students/unskilled personas and whoever interested in order to give the people some skill, keep track of how they progress, collaborate with schools and ministry in order to increase motivation to this platform and take over university lectures which are taught in a very non professional way; basically, a video provider of tutorials.
